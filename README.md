# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

# Modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.

All of my scripts are available in `.local/bin/statusbar` folder [here](https://github.com/paniash/dotfiles).

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/paniash/dwmblocks
